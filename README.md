# Project Name

This project is a demonstration of using AI-assisted coding to rapidly develop and test new approaches in software development. The project was created in a couple of hours using Aider, an AI tool designed to assist developers in writing and refactoring code efficiently.

## Overview

The project includes several components that work together to interpret and execute bytecode. It features a lexer, parser, and interpreters for both JavaScript and WebAssembly environments. The goal is to provide a flexible and efficient way to evaluate expressions and execute bytecode.

## Features

- **Lexer and Parser**: Convert source code into tokens and parse them into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- **Bytecode Interpreter**: Execute bytecode instructions using different interpreters.
- **WebAssembly Support**: Leverage WebAssembly for executing bytecode in a performant manner.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Utilized Aider to streamline the development process and implement features quickly.
